            <h2>Craemon</h2>
            is one of the two owners and also the admin of the Minelife SMP and has therefore been a member since the very beginning of Season I.<br>
            The custom datapacks and resourcepacks he creates for Minelife as the admin are available for download on his Modrinth or Github page. <br><br>
            In Season I he started multiple bases together with Venym (all of which failed for various different reasons), built many large scale farms and worked on the automated shop "Punkt Corp" and a casino in the shopping district. He placed 4th place in Jo_0924s PvP-Event and got banned once for rigging an election advert on his property with tnt.<br> His activities from that season are partially covered in a german YouTube series.<br><br>
            His Season II base was a custom built village with automated farms hidden behind custom terrain. Season II was meant to be covered by an english YouTube series but due to technical difficulties at the start and the shortlived nature of the season that never happened.<br><br>
            In the ongoing Season III Craemon is building multiple different biome themed villages and large scale builds such as the townhall or an automatic minecart network across the entire server. He also hosts an annual easter egg hunting event and competed in Venyms PvP-Event, placing on 4th once again.<br> All major builds and projects of Craemon are covered in his YouTube series.

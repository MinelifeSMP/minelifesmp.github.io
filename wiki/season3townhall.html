            <h2>The Season III Townhall</h2>
            <section class="wikisection">
                The Minelife SMP Season III townhall is the centerpiece of the shopping district!<br>
                It was designed by Craemon, Venym and Fricaii before the start of the season, inspired by the Minelife Season I Townhall and the Hermitcraft S7 Townhall built as well as a transformation of it.<br>
                Although the basic design was finished by the start of the season (31st of March 2023) it wasn't until August that Craemon refined the design and built it on the actual server. <br>
                Since the it has pretty much never been used.

            <h3>Features:</h3>
            <section class="wikisection">
                The townhall currently has a large entrance hall, a paternoster elevator and a senate room up in the dome.<br>
                It also has a lot of unused potential :)

            <h3>Future plans:</h3>
            <section class="wikisection">
                In the future the Townhall might actually be used or have it's interior finished. <br>
                The Townhall will also feature it's own station on the server-wide minecart network, it will be connected to the northbound rail running directly under it.<br>
                Visitors will be able to use the paternoster elevator from the station up to the lobby area.

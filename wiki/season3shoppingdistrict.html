                    The Minelife SMP Season III shopping district is the biggest community effort project accross all three seasons of the Minelife SMP!<br>
                    With the location of the shopping district having been chosen even before the season began the first shops got constructed as early as the first week of the server.<br>
                    Nowadays the shopping district is home to many different shops offering goods like wood and food or different services!<br>
                    Naturally some of Minelifes most impressive builds and ambitious mega projects have been built in or around the shopping district...<br>

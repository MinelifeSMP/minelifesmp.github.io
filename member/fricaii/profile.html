            <h2>Fricaii</h2>
            is one of the first members to join the Minelife SMP. He's a creative and lazy player sticking to what he's comfortable with: building trees and creating armorstand masterpieces!
            Building bases is not his strong suit but when it comes to decorations he gets lost in the details. <br> <br>
            In season I he started out with Venym and Craemon, later moving his entire house far away into a taiga biome, where he lived for the rest of the season.
            His base was demolished and rebuilt by Venym and Craemon as a birthday present. <br> <br>
            For season II he started out basing with Craemon in a village, later moving out and starting construction on his own base, never finishing it. <br><br>
            Season III, the ongoing season saw rise to another Fricaii base. He built a mushroom like house on the coast, south-west of spawn as a starter base. For his megabase he plans on building a giant tree with a custom biome surrounding it.

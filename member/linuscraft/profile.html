            <h2>Linuscraft</h2>
            joined Minelife at the start of Season I. Having been an aktiv member of all three seasons so far, there are a lot of builds and projects from him.<br><br>
            In season one he formed a group with a few other members called the "Redboots", identified by their symbol of red boots. Together they built a base, shops and held events.<br>
            Linuscraft also made a german video series in this season which is sadly not available to watch anymore.<br><br>
            In season two a few of the Redboots members, including Linuscraft, collaborated on yet another base. The base included different farms and was supposed to have the first iteration of The Redboots House.<br><br>
            His season three builds include a lot of Redboots focused stuff in the shopping district. One of them being the finally built Redboots House.<br>
            He also constructed a little beach island next to the townhall.
